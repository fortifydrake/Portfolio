## 👀 What Changed at a Glance

### HERO SECTION
```
BEFORE:  Hi, I'm Aditya Prasad
         ML Engineer | Data Scientist | Data Engineering
         Building intelligent solutions with ML, NLP...

AFTER:   Data Science + MLOps Engineer
         Python | ML Pipelines | Drift Detection | Model Deployment
         Building production-grade ML systems...
         
         [View Projects] [Contact Me]
```

### NAVIGATION
```
BEFORE:  Home, About, Skills, Projects, LeetCode, Education, Certificates, Contact
AFTER:   Home, Projects, About, Skills, Resume, Contact
         (Focused on recruiter hiring flow)
```

### ABOUT SECTION
```
BEFORE:  3 sentences + 4 highlight cards (too much)
AFTER:   2 sentences, specific MLOps focus (concise)
```

### PROJECTS
```
BEFORE:  4 projects, generic descriptions
AFTER:   2 featured (case studies), 2 supporting
         Each shows: Problem → Solution → Result → Metrics
```

---

## 💡 Key Concepts to Understand

### 1. Case Study Format
Each project now follows:
- **Problem:** What's the pain point?
- **Solution:** How did you solve it?
- **Result:** What's the measurable impact?

Example:
```
Problem: ML models degrade in production due to drift
Solution: Built Evidently AI + Airflow monitoring system
Result: Reduced recovery time from DAYS to MINUTES
```

### 2. Featured vs. Supporting Projects
- **Featured (2):** Self-Healing Pipeline, MyBudgetAI
  - Get prominent placement
  - Shown as case studies
  - Have metrics/results
  
- **Supporting (2):** Spam Detection, Chatbot
  - Compact format
  - Show breadth of skills
  - Still have demo/GitHub links

### 3. MLOps Focus
Portfolio now emphasizes:
- ✅ **Production thinking** (not just "building models")
- ✅ **Monitoring & drift detection**
- ✅ **Automated retraining**
- ✅ **Reliable systems**

This is more in-demand than generic "ML engineer"

### 4. Metrics & Proof
Every project now has:
- ✅ Quantified results (95% accuracy, days→minutes)
- ✅ Live demo or code
- ✅ Tech stack showing depth

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### What Recruiters See Now

**In first 20 seconds:**
1. "Oh, MLOps engineer" (clear specialization)
2. "Production experience with monitoring" (maturity signal)
3. "95% accuracy, days→minutes recovery" (proof of work)
4. "Live demo + GitHub code" (verifiable)

**Likely action:** Click "Contact" or view GitHub

### Before vs. After
```
BEFORE: "Nice portfolio... looks like a student project"
AFTER:  "This person knows production ML. Let's interview them."
```

## 🎓 Three Things Every Recruiter Looks For

✅ **Clarity** - What do you do?
- Before: Unclear (ML engineer? Data scientist?)
- After: Clear (MLOps engineer)

✅ **Proof** - Can you actually do it?
- Before: Descriptions
- After: Metrics + live demos + code

✅ **Specialization** - Are you deep or broad?
- Before: Broad (ML, NLP, DSA, Data Engineering)
- After: Deep (MLOps, production systems, drift detection)

**Your portfolio now scores high on all three.**

## 💬 Example Pitch (Use This!)

When telling people about your portfolio:

> "I upgraded my portfolio to focus on my MLOps work. I now position myself as an MLOps engineer who builds production ML systems, not just a student who does ML projects. The portfolio shows 2 main case studies—my Self-Healing Pipeline that detects drift and auto-retrains, and MyBudgetAI that uses NLP for expense categorization. Each project shows the problem I solved and the metrics I achieved."

---

## 🎯 Success Indicators

You'll know the upgrade worked when:

1. **More recruiter messages** on LinkedIn
2. **More interview requests** from applications
3. **Easier elevator pitches** (now you have clear specialization)
4. **Confidence in interviews** (you have stories to tell)

---

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: "Should I change the color scheme?"**
A: No, the current blue + gold is professional and works well. Focus on content, not design tweaks.

**Q: "Should I add more projects?"**
A: No, quality > quantity. 2 featured + 2 supporting is perfect.

**Q: "When should I add screenshots?"**
A: ASAP (takes 15 min). Huge impact on engagement.

**Q: "Should I add GitHub stats widget?"**
A: Nice to have, but not critical. Focus on core content first.
