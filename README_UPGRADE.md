## 🎯 INTERNSHIP INTERVIEW PREP

### Common Questions & Your Answers

**Q: "Tell me about your strongest project"**

A: "My Self-Healing MLOps Pipeline project demonstrates production ML thinking. The problem was that models degrade in production due to data drift—manual retraining was reactive and slow. I built a system using Evidently AI for drift detection with Apache Airflow orchestration that automatically triggers retraining. Result: reduced recovery time from days to minutes. The project is live on Hugging Face Spaces and handles hundreds of transactions."

**Q: "What interests you about MLOps?"**

A: "I care about making ML reliable in production, not just accurate. Accuracy is one thing, but a model that drifts is worthless. I'm interested in the monitoring, testing, and automation side—making sure systems are self-healing and production-ready."

**Q: "Why Python and Airflow specifically?"**

A: "Python is the de facto standard for ML and data work. Airflow is great for orchestrating complex ML workflows—it gives you visibility into pipelines and makes automation easy. Combined with tools like Evidently for monitoring, it enables the kind of production-grade systems I'm interested in building."
