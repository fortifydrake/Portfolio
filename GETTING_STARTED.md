## 🎯 KEY CHANGES AT A GLANCE

### Hero Section
- **Old:** "Hi, I'm Aditya Prasad | ML Engineer | Data Scientist"
- **New:** "Data Science + MLOps Engineer | Python | Pipelines | Drift Detection"
- **Why:** Specific specialization (MLOps) stands out

### Navigation
- **Old:** 8 items (Home, About, Skills, Projects, LeetCode, Education, Certificates, Contact)
- **New:** 6 items (Home, Projects, About, Skills, Resume, Contact)
- **Why:** Focused on hiring flow (portfolio first)

### About
- **Old:** 3 sentences + 4 highlight cards

### Featured
- **Old:** 4 equal projects
- **New:** 2 featured (case studies) + 2 supporting
- **Why:** Quality over quantity

---

## ✨ WHAT MAKES IT WORK

### 1. Clarity (First 3 seconds)
"Data Science + MLOps Engineer" = Immediately clear

### 2. Proof (Next 10 seconds)
- 2 case studies showing impact
- Metrics: "95% accuracy", "days→minutes"
- Live demos + code

### 3. Specialization (Next 5 seconds)
MLOps-focused (not generic ML) = More in-demand

### 4. Action (Last 2 seconds)
Clear CTAs: "View Projects", "Contact Me"

---

## 🎓 EXAMPLES

### Old Messaging
"I built a self-healing ML pipeline using Evidently AI and Airflow"

### New Messaging
"I solved the problem of ML models degrading in production. Built a self-healing pipeline that automatically detects drift and retrains models, reducing recovery time from days to minutes."

**The second one shows impact and business value.**

## 💡 QUICK TIPS

### Don't:
- ❌ Don't over-design (keep it simple)
- ❌ Don't add too many projects (2 featured is perfect)

- ❌ Don't forget metrics (95% accuracy ≠ "high accuracy")

### Do:
- ✅ Do emphasize production thinking (monitoring, drift)
- ✅ Do show impact (problem solved, metrics improved)
- ✅ Do keep it professional (recruiters scan, not read)
- ✅ Do include live demos and code
- ✅ Do test on mobile
